- **PostgreSQL:** The database system I chose for its robustness, perfect for dealing with complex job postings data.
- **Visual Studio Code:** The primary platform for managing databases and running SQL queries.
- **Excel:** A crucial tool for visualizing the outcomes of my SQL queries.
- **Git & GitHub:** Key for keeping track of my progress and sharing my SQL work, ensuring everything stayed organized and accessible.
# Analysis Breakdown
In this project, every SQL query I executed aimed to uncover specific layers of the data analyst job market. Here's the strategy I took to approach each critical question:
### 1. High-Paying Data Analyst Roles in California
I wanted to find full-time data analyst jobs with the top salaries, whether those positions were in California or offered the flexibility of working remotely. To do this, I filtered by average yearly salaries and job locations, specifically on California and "Anywhere" listings. This query highlights the top-paying opportunities for full-time data analysts, spotlighting the fieldâ€™s salary leaders.
```sql
SELECT 
    jp.job_id,
    jp.job_title,
    jp.job_location,
    jp.job_schedule_type,
    jp.salary_year_avg,
    jp.job_posted_date,
    cd.name AS company_name
FROM 
    job_postings_fact jp
    LEFT JOIN company_dim cd 
    ON jp.company_id = cd.company_id
WHERE 
    jp.job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
    AND (jp.job_location LIKE '%, CA' OR jp.job_location = 'Anywhere')
    AND jp.salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    AND EXTRACT(YEAR FROM jp.job_posted_date) = 2023
    AND jp.job_schedule_type = 'Full-time'
ORDER BY 
    jp.salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
Here's the breakdown of the top data analyst jobs in 2023:
- **Wide Salary Range:** The salary range for the top 10 Data Analyst roles is quite broad, with figures stretching from **$224,500** to an impressive **$650,000**.

### 2. Skills for Top-Paying Data Analyst Jobs
To understand the skill set behind these lucrative data analyst roles, I pulled the top-paying jobs from my initial search and joined them with the related skills data. This SQL query connected the high salaries to the specific skills needed for each role, painting a clearer picture of the technical and analytical competencies commanding premium pay in the market.
``` sql
WITH top_paying_jobs AS (
    SELECT 
        jp.job_id,
        jp.job_title,
        jp.salary_year_avg,
        cd.name AS company_name
    FROM 
        job_postings_fact jp
    LEFT JOIN company_dim cd ON jp.company_id = cd.company_id
    WHERE 
        jp.job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
        AND (jp.job_location LIKE '%, CA' OR jp.job_location = 'Anywhere')
        AND jp.salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
        AND EXTRACT(YEAR FROM jp.job_posted_date) = 2023
        AND jp.job_schedule_type = 'Full-time'
    ORDER BY 
        jp.salary_year_avg DESC
    LIMIT 10
)

SELECT 
    tpj.*,
    sd.skills
FROM 
    top_paying_jobs tpj
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim sjd ON tpj.job_id = sjd.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim sd ON sjd.skill_id = sd.skill_id
ORDER BY
    tpj.salary_year_avg DESC;
```
The results were telling:

- **In-Demand Skills:** The SQL query revealed that SQL, Python, and R are among the most in-demand skills for the highest-paying data analyst jobs, with SQL appearing as a common requirement across different roles and companies.
- **Skill Variance Across Roles:** There was a notable variance in skills among different job titles. For instance, Data Analyst positions emphasized Python and SQL, whereas roles like "Analytics Director" and "Data & Intelligence Manager" often required a broader skill set, including data visualization tools like Tableau and business intelligence platforms like Power BI.
- **Tech-Savvy Employers:** The high-paying roles are available at tech-centric companies like Anthropic, Meta, and TikTok, which tend to look for candidates with a strong foundation in programming, data manipulation, and visualization skills.

*The analysis of these skills not only informs about what employers are currently seeking but also serves as a guide for professionals aiming to enter the top tiers of the data analyst job market.*
### 3. Most In-Demand Skills for Data Analysts
To zero in on the skills most sought after by employers for data analyst positions, I executed a SQL query to aggregate and count the frequency of each skill mentioned across job listings. The focus was on full-time roles in California or remote positions posted in 2023. This approach not only identifies the most in-demand skills but also quantifies their demand, providing a clear indicator of what skills data analysts should prioritize.
```sql
SELECT 
    sd.skills,
    COUNT(sjd.job_id) AS demand_count
FROM 
    job_postings_fact jp
INNER JOIN 
    skills_job_dim sjd ON jp.job_id = sjd.job_id
INNER JOIN 
    skills_dim sd ON sjd.skill_id = sd.skill_id
WHERE 
    jp.job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
    AND (jp.job_location LIKE '%, CA' OR jp.job_location = 'Anywhere')
    AND jp.salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    AND EXTRACT(YEAR FROM jp.job_posted_date) = 2023
    AND jp.job_schedule_type = 'Full-time' 
GROUP BY 
    sd.skills
ORDER BY 
    demand_count DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
The query's findings reveal:

- **SQL Reigns Supreme:** SQL stands out as the most demanded skill with 781 listings, underscoring its foundational role in data analysis.
